# SYSADMIN Role in Snowflake

## Overview
The `SYSADMIN` role in Snowflake is primarily responsible for managing infrastructure-related objects such as warehouses, databases, and schemas. It provides control over all user-created objects but does not manage user access and security settings.

## Responsibilities
- Create, modify, and delete warehouses
- Create, modify, and delete databases
- Manage schemas and tables
- Assign privileges to roles for object management
- Oversee the performance and resource usage of the system

## Actions It Cannot Take
- Create or manage users and roles (handled by `USERADMIN`)
- Manage security policies and grants globally (handled by `SECURITYADMIN`)
- Perform account-level administrative tasks (handled by `ACCOUNTADMIN`)

## Best Practices
- Assign the `SYSADMIN` role to users who need to manage data infrastructure but do not require access to security settings.
- Attach custom roles to `SYSADMIN` to inherit its privileges for object management.
- Avoid using `SYSADMIN` for user or security management to maintain a clean separation of duties.
