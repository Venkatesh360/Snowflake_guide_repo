# PUBLIC Role in Snowflake

## Overview
The PUBLIC role in Snowflake is a system-defined role that is automatically granted to every user in the system. It serves as a baseline role with minimal privileges and is primarily used to provide default access to common objects within a Snowflake environment.

## Key Characteristics
- Every user in Snowflake is assigned the PUBLIC role by default.
- The PUBLIC role can be granted access to objects that should be available to all users.
- It does not have administrative privileges or the ability to modify other roles or users.
- The role is useful for managing shared resources across different users.

## Privileges
The PUBLIC role typically has access to:
- Certain default database objects (if explicitly granted access by an administrator).
- Publically available functions and utilities within Snowflake.
- Objects explicitly granted to PUBLIC by other roles.

## Limitations
- The PUBLIC role cannot create, modify, or drop objects unless explicitly granted permissions.
- It cannot manage users, roles, or system-level configurations.
- It does not inherit any privileges from higher-level roles like ACCOUNTADMIN or SYSADMIN.

## Best Practices
- Assign specific privileges to PUBLIC only if necessary, as all users will inherit them.
- Avoid granting sensitive data access to PUBLIC to maintain security.
- Use more specific roles for access control instead of relying on PUBLIC for permission management.

By understanding the PUBLIC role and its limitations, organizations can better manage access control and maintain a secure Snowflake environment.
