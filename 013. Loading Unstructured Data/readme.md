# Loading Unstructured Data into Snowflake

Snowflake supports loading **unstructured data** (e.g., images, PDFs, videos, JSON, XML) using **stages** and the `PUT` and `COPY INTO` commands.

---

## üìå Steps to Load Unstructured Data

1. **Create an Internal or External Stage**
2. **Upload Files to the Stage**
3. **Load Data into a Table**
4. **Query and Process Unstructured Data**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Stage
A **stage** is a location to store unstructured data before loading it into Snowflake.

### ‚úÖ Internal Stage Example:
```sql
CREATE STAGE my_stage;
```
- Stores files inside **Snowflake-managed storage**.

### ‚úÖ External Stage Example (AWS S3):
```sql
CREATE STAGE my_s3_stage
URL='s3://my-bucket/'
STORAGE_INTEGRATION = my_s3_integration;
```
- Uses **Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Uploading Unstructured Data

### ‚úÖ Uploading to Internal Stage:
```sh
PUT file://path/to/myfile.pdf @my_stage;
```
- Uploads `myfile.pdf` to `my_stage`.

For **external stages**, upload files directly to cloud storage.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Loading Data into a Table

### ‚úÖ Creating a Table with a Variant Column:
```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id INT AUTOINCREMENT,
    filename STRING,
    content VARIANT
);
```

### ‚úÖ Loading JSON or XML Data:
```sql
COPY INTO my_table(filename, content)
FROM @my_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'JSON');
```
- Snowflake automatically converts JSON/XML data into a **structured format**.

For **binary files (PDF, images, videos)**, store them as metadata and process externally.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Querying and Processing Unstructured Data

### ‚úÖ Querying JSON Data:
```sql
SELECT content:data FROM my_table;
```

### ‚úÖ Extracting Metadata from Files:
```sql
SELECT METADATA$FILENAME, METADATA$FILE_ROW_NUMBER FROM @my_stage;
```
- Retrieves file metadata from staged files.

## üîÑ Automating Unstructured Data Processing
- **Use Snowflake Functions** to process JSON/XML directly.
- **Integrate with AI/ML tools** for image or text analysis.
- **Leverage External Functions** for advanced processing.
