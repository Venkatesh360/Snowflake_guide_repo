# Snowflake

## Overview
Snowflake is a self-managed data cloud platform that enables data storage, processing, and analytics with enhanced flexibility and performance compared to traditional systems. It is not built on existing database technologies but combines a new SQL engine with a cloud-native architecture.

## Data Platform as a Self-Managed Service
- No hardware or software installation required.
- Fully managed maintenance, upgrades, and tuning.
- Runs entirely on public cloud infrastructure.
- Uses virtual compute instances for processing and cloud storage for persistence.
