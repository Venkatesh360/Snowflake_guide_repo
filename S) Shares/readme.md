# Shares in Snowflake: Secure Data Sharing Explained

## 1. Overview of Snowflake Shares
Snowflakeâ€™s Secure Data Sharing allows organizations to share live data with external or internal users without copying or moving data. This is done using Shares, which provide read-only access to databases, schemas, and tables.

## 2. Key Features of Secure Data Sharing
- **Zero Copy** â€“ No data duplication; shared data remains in the provider's account.
- **Real-Time Access** â€“ Consumers always access the most recent data.
- **Granular Control** â€“ Share entire databases, schemas, or specific tables.
- **No Additional Cost** â€“ Consumers only pay for queries, not storage.

## 3. How Snowflake Shares Work
### 1. Data Provider (Owner)
- Owns the data and creates a Share.
- Grants read-only access to specific objects.
- Sends an invitation to the Consumer.

### 2. Data Consumer
- Accepts the share using their Snowflake account.
- Queries the data without storing or copying it.
- Cannot modify the shared data (only read access).

## 4. Creating and Managing Shares
### 4.1 Creating a Share
The data provider uses the `CREATE SHARE` command to share data.

```sql
CREATE SHARE sales_data_share;
```

### 4.2 Granting Access to a Database, Schema, or Table
After creating the share, grant access to specific objects.

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE sales_db TO SHARE sales_data_share;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA sales_db.revenue TO SHARE sales_data_share;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE sales_db.revenue.transactions TO SHARE sales_data_share;
```

### 4.3 Adding a Consumer Account
The provider must add the consumer's Snowflake account to allow access.

```sql
ALTER SHARE sales_data_share ADD ACCOUNT = 'consumer_account_id';
```

### 4.4 Viewing Shares
List all shares in the provider's account.

```sql
SHOW SHARES;
```

## 5. Accessing Shared Data (Consumer Side)
### 5.1 Viewing Incoming Shares
A consumer can check available shared data.

```sql
SHOW IMPORTED DATABASES;
```

### 5.2 Creating a Database from a Share
To use shared data, the consumer creates a database from the share.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sales_db_shared FROM SHARE provider_account.sales_data_share;
```

### 5.3 Querying the Shared Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_db_shared.revenue.transactions;
```
The consumer can read but cannot modify or copy the data.

## 6. Revoking & Dropping Shares
### 6.1 Removing a Consumer
To revoke access, the provider removes the consumerâ€™s account.

```sql
ALTER SHARE sales_data_share REMOVE ACCOUNT = 'consumer_account_id';
```

### 6.2 Dropping a Share
If a share is no longer needed, it can be deleted.

```sql
DROP SHARE sales_data_share;
```

## 7. Use Cases of Secure Data Sharing
- **Data Monetization** â€“ Sell live data to external customers.
- **Cross-Department Sharing** â€“ Share data within a company without duplication.
- **Collaboration with Partners** â€“ Provide suppliers or vendors with real-time insights.
- **Regulatory Compliance** â€“ Share data securely for audits or government reporting.

## 8. Key Benefits of Snowflake Shares
- ðŸš€ **Performance** â€“ Consumers query real-time data without delays.
- ðŸ”’ **Security** â€“ Providers control access, ensuring no unauthorized copies.
- ðŸ’° **Cost Savings** â€“ No need to move or duplicate large datasets.

## 9. Summary
- **Shares enable live, read-only data access without duplication.**
- **Providers create shares and grant access to consumers.**
- **Consumers accept shares and query data in real time.**
- **No extra storage cost for consumersâ€”only query execution is charged.**

This makes Secure Data Sharing in Snowflake a game-changer for modern data collaboration. ðŸš€
